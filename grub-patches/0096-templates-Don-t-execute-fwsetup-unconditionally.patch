Subject: [PATCH] templates: Don't execute fwsetup unconditionally
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Commit 26031d3b1016 ("efi: Don't display a uefi-firmware entry if it's not
supported") added a new `fwsetup --is-supported` option that could be used
to check if the firmware allows to enter into a firmware user interface.

That option was then used by /etc/grub.d/30_uefi-firmware script to figure
out whether a `fwsetup` entry should be included or not in the boot menu.

But unfortunately, old GRUB images will fail to boot if are booted with an
updated GRUB config file. Since the `fwsetup --is-supported` call would be
taken as a plan `fwsetup` with no options.

This could either lead to a crash (i.e: on legacy BIOS systems where that
is not supported) or to the machine entering into the firmware settings.

To prevent that, let's partially revert the mentioned commit and keep the
old logic that didn't execute the `fwsetup` command and just included an
entry for it if GRUB is executed in an EFI platform.

supported")
